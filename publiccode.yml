    shortDescription: >-
      Web Service built on top of hypoinverse, a software used to Locate earthquakes.
    documentation: 'https://github.com/INGV/hyp2000-ws/blob/master/README.md'
    longDescription: >
      Hypoinverse is software used to Locate earthquakes and determine magnitudes in a local or regional seismic network.

      More info aboute Hypoinverse, here: https://www.usgs.gov/software/hypoinverse-earthquake-location

      At INGV we build stand-alone Docker to deploy "hyp2000" (https://github.com/ingv/hyp2000) and on top of that was buit a Web Service; It gets in input a JSON file with phases and amplitudes. 
      For each station name, It searches the metadata (like Lat and Long) on the FDSN-StationXML Web Services around the world.
      
      The output could be in a standard format like ARC and PRT or in JSON.
